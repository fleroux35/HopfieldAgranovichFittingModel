# HopfieldAgranovichFittingModel

This repository includes Matlab files enabling the fitting of datasets from angle resolved white light reflectivity measurements on microcavities containing strongly coupled excitons.

The model can include up to two exciton resonances.

A presentation of the model can be found in the thesis: 'Tuning Light-Matter Interaction Inside Organic Microcavities Using Semiconducting
Polymer Chain Geometry' University of Oxford - (2020).

The model is based on the seminal works by Hopfield et. al [1] and Agranovich et. al [2]
